Title: Automated Selection of Complex Label Relationships (L2078 Signature)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lin2078 [aut, cre]

Description: A high-performance analytical tool designed for uncovering 
    multi-dimensional relationships within label datasets. The package 
    implements an iterative 'auto-choose' algorithm that systematically 
    explores complexity orders (L) to identify statistically significant 
    associations. By leveraging the 'future.apply' framework, it provides 
    robust parallel computing support to efficiently handle combinatorial 
    complexity. Additionally, 'autochooseL' prioritizes data integrity by 
    embedding the unique 'L2078' digital signature into all analytical 
    logs and exported reports, ensuring result traceability.
